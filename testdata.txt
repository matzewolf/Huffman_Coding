THESE COURSES CAN PROVIDESECTIONFEATURES OF THE BOOKSOME HIGHLIGHTS OF THE BOOK INCLUDEBEGINITEMIZEITEM AN EMPHASIS ON VECTORSPACE GEOMETRY WHICH PUTS LEASTSQUARES  AND MINIMUM MEANSQUARES IN THE SAME FRAMEWORK  THE CONCEPT OF  SIGNALS AS VECTORS IN AN APPROPRIATE VECTOR SPACE IS EMPHASIZED  THE VECTOR SPACE APPROACH PROVIDES A NATURAL FRAMEWORK FOR TOPICS  SUCH AS WAVELET TRANSFORMS AND DIGITAL COMMUNICATIONS AS WELL AS  THE TRADITIONAL TOPICS SUCH AS OPTIMUM PREDICTION FILTERING AND  ESTIMATION  IN THIS CONTEXT THE MORE GENERAL NOTION OF METRIC  SPACES IS INTRODUCED WITH A DISCUSSION OF SIGNAL NORMSITEM A THOROUGH DESCRIPTION OF THE LINEAR ALGEBRA USED IN SIGNAL  PROCESSING BOTH IN CONCEPT AND IN NUMERICAL IMPLEMENTATION  WHILE  LIBRARIES ARE COMMONLY AVAILABLE TO DO LINEAR ALGEBRA COMPUTATIONS  WE FEEL THAT THE NUMERICAL TECHNIQUES PRESENTED EXERCISE INTUITION  ON THE GEOMETRY OF VECTOR SPACES AND BUILD UNDERSTANDING OF THE  ISSUES THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED IN PRACTICAL PROBLEMS  THE LINEAR ALGEBRA INCLUDES A THOROUGH DISCUSSION OF EIGENBASED  METHOD OF COMPUTATION INCLUDING EIGENFILTERS MUSIC AND ESPRIT  THERE IS ALSO A CHAPTER DEVOTED TO THE PROPERTIES AND APPLICATIONS  OF THE SVD  TOEPLITZ MATRICES WHICH APPEAR THROUGHOUT THE SIGNAL  PROCESSING LITERATURE ARE TREATED BOTH FROM A NUMERICAL POINT OF  VIEW  AS AN EXAMPLE OF RECURSIVE ALGORITHMS  AND ALSO IN  CONJUNCTION WITH THE LATTICEFILTERING INTERPRETATION      THE MATRICES IN LINEAR ALGEBRA ARE VIEWED AS OPERATORS AND THE  IMPORTANT CONCEPT OF AN OPERATOR IS INTRODUCED  ASSOCIATED NOTIONS  SUCH AS RANGE NULLSPACE AND NORM OF AN OPERATOR ARE PRESENTED  WHILE A FULL COVERAGE OF OPERATOR THEORY IS NOT PROVIDED THERE IS A  STRONG FOUNDATION HERE THAT SERVES TO BUILD INSIGHT FOR OTHER  OPERATORS  ITEM IN

CONCEPTUAL CONTENT  WEPROPOSE THE FOLLOWING AS A TENTATIVE DEFINITION OF SIGNAL PROCESSINGAT LEAST FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS BOOKBEGINDEFINITION INDEXSIGNAL PROCESSING DEFINITION  BF SIGNAL PROCESSING IS THAT AREA OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS THAT DEALS  WITH OPERATIONS ON OR ANALYSIS OF SIGNALS IN EITHER DISCRETE OR  CONTINUOUS TIME TO PERFORM USEFUL OPERATIONS ON THOSE SIGNALSENDDEFINITIONWITH ITS FOCUS ON APPLIED MATHEMATICS THIS BOOK NEGLECTS SEVERALIMPORTANT ASPECTS OF SIGNAL PROCESSING INCLUDING HARDWARE DESIGN ANDIMPLEMENTATION ON SIGNAL PROCESSING CHIPS  USEFUL OPERATIONIS DELIBERATELY LEFT AMBIGUOUS  DEPENDING UPON THE APPLICATION AUSEFUL OPERATION COULD BE CONTROL DATA COMPRESSION DATATRANSMISSION DENOISING PREDICTION FILTERING SMOOTHING DEBLURRINGTOMOGRAPHIC RECONSTRUCTION IDENTIFICATION CLASSIFICATION OR AVARIETY OF OTHER OPERATIONS THE PRIMARY INTENT OF THIS BOOK IS BF TO PRESENT A TREATMENT OF  RELEVANT MATHEMATICS SO THAT STUDENTS AND PRACTITIONERS OF SIGNAL  PROCESSING AND RELATED FIELDS ARE ABLE TO READ APPLY AND  ULTIMATELY CONTRIBUTE TO A VARIETY OF AREAS OF SIGNAL PROCESSING  RESEARCH AND PRACTICE  THE INTENT IS NOT TO EXPLORE PUREMATHEMATICS HOWEVER BUT RATHER TO PROVIDE A MATHEMATICAL MODICUMSUFFICIENT TO EXPLAIN AND EXPLORE THE MORE IMPORTANT MATHEMATICALPARADIGMS USED IN SIGNAL PROCESSING EM ALGORITHMS  A STUDENT WITHA BACKGROUND FROM THIS BOOK SHOULD BE ABLE TO MOVE EXPEDITIOUSLY TO APARTICULAR AREA OF INTEREST AND BEGIN MAKING EFFECTIVE PROGRESS IN THESPECIALIZED LITERATURE OF THAT AREA  WE HAVE ENDEAVORED TO MAINTAIN APRECARIOUS BALANCE PURISTS IN MATHEMATICS WILL FIND SOME OF THEANALYTICAL METHODS DEFICIENT WHILE PRAGMATISTS WILL ARGUE THAT THEREARE FAR TOO MANY EQUATIONS  TO USE A GARAGE ANALOGY WE HAVE PROVIDEDENOUGH INFORMATION TO GET UNDER THE HOOD OF THE CAR TAKING APART FOREXAMINATION MANY OF THE ENGINE COMPONENTS BUT WITHOUT GETTING INTODETAIL AT THE LEVEL OF METALLURGICAL PHENOMENA  SUCH MINUTEINVESTIGATIONS ARE BEST CONDUCTED AFTER THE STUDENT UNDERSTANDS HOWTHE CAR OPERATES  IN ADDITION TO THEORY THE BOOK CONTAINS AVARIETY OF MATERIAL COMPARABLE TO WHAT IS FOUND IN OTHER ADVANCEDSIGNAL PROCESSING TEXTS  IN ADDITION TO THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THIS BOOK THERE ARE TWO OTHERSFIRST TO DEVELOP WITHIN THE STUDENT A DEGREE OF MATHEMATICALMATURITY  THE STUDENT WITH THIS MATURITY WILL IT IS HOPED BE ABLETO ORGANIZE EFFECTIVE APPROACHES OF HISHER OWN TO A VARIETY OFPROBLEMS  THIS MATURITY WILL BE DEVELOPED BY WORKING PROBLEMSFOLLOWING AND DOING PROOFS AND WRITING AND RUNNING PROGRAMSITEM IN ADDITION TO THE MATHEMATICAL CONTENT THE SC MATLAB  PROGRAMS PROVIDED IN THE BOOK SHOULD BE USEFUL BOTH AS STANDALONE  FUNCTIONS AND AS BUILDING BLOCKS TO FURTHER UNDERSTANDINGSECOND THE BOOK IS INTENDED AS A USEFUL REFERENCE WITH REFERENCEMATERIAL GATHERED ON SEVERAL AREAS IN SIGNAL PROCESSING SUCHAS DERIVATIVES LINEAR ALGEBRA OPTIMIZATION INEQUALITIES ETCTHIS STATEMENT OF INTENT SHOULD MAKE CLEAR WHAT THIS BOOK IS NOTTHERE ARE SEVERAL VERY GOOD BOOKS AVAILABLE ON APPLICATION AREAS INSIGNAL PROCESSING SUCH AS SPECTRUM ESTIMATION ADAPTIVE FILTERINGARRAY PROCESSING AND SO ON THIS BOOK DOES NOT CHOOSE ANY OF THOSEPARTICULAR AREAS AS ITS FOCUS  THUS WHILE MANY DIFFERENT TECHNIQUESOF SPECTRUM ESTIMATION WILL BE PRESENTED AS APPLICATIONS OF THETECHNIQUES DISCOVERED ISSUES CENTRAL TO THE STUDY OF

AS BACKGROUND  STUDENTS SHOULD  BE ACQUAINTED WITH PROBABILITY AND HAVE HAD A COURSE IN STOCHASTIC  PROCESSES AS A PREREQUISITE TO THIS BOOK  PROBABILITY IS AN  IMPORTANT TOOL AND STUDENTS ARE ADVISED TO CONTINUE SHARPENING  THEIR SKILLS WITH IT  A BRIEF REVIEW OF IMPORTANT TOPICS IN  STOCHASTIC PROCESSES IS PROVIDED IN APPENDIX REFAPPDXRP  ITEMPROGRAMMING A SIGNAL PROCESSOR MUST KNOW HOW TO PROGRAM IN AT  LEAST ONE HIGHLEVEL LANGUAGE  IN MOST CASES SIGNAL PROCESSING  ULTIMATELY BOILS DOWN TO A SOFTWARE OR HARDWARE IMPLEMENTATION ON  SOME KIND OF COMPUTING PLATFORM  THIS REQUIRES DEPLOYMENT OF THE  CONCEPT SIMULATION AND TESTING ALL USUALLY SOFTWARERELATED  ACTIVITIES  AN UNDERSTANDING OF BASIC PROGRAMMING CONCEPTS SUCH AS  VARIABLES PROGRAM FLOW RECURSION DATA STRUCTURES AND

REFCHAPKRONECKER  ARE DEVOTED LARGELY TO LINEAR ALGEBRA AND ITS APPLICATIONSITEMNUMERICAL METHODS WITH THE INCREASING PENETRATION OF COMPUTERS  INTO ENGINEERING CULTURE THERE IS PARADOXICALLY A DECREASE IN MANY  STUDENTS EXPOSURE TO NUMERICAL METHODS  AND YET A SIGNIFICANT  PORTION OF SIGNAL PROCESSING CONSISTS OF NOTHING MORE THAN NUMERICAL  METHODS APPLIED TO A PARTICULAR SET OF PROBLEMS INVOLVING SIGNALS  MANY OF THE TECHNIQUES DESCRIBED IN THIS BOOK ARE BORROWED FROM THE  NUMERICAL METHODS LITERATUREITEMFUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS IN SIGNAL PROCESSING A SIGNAL IS A  FUNCTION  THE TOOLS FROM FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK  FROM WHICH TO VIEW THE SIGNAL LEADING THE WAY TO POWERFUL SIGNAL  TRANSFORMS AND SIGNAL SPACES IN DIGITAL COMMUNICATIONS  IN THIS  BOOK WE PRESENT CONCEPTS

SCIENCE OF MAKING DECISIONS IN THE FACE OF RANDOM  UNCERTAINTY  SUCH DECISIONMAKING ALSO DESCRIBES WHAT IS DONE IN  MANY SIGNAL PROCESSING APPLICATIONS  THE APPLICATION OF STATISTICS  TO SIGNAL

POLYNOMIALS  ARE ALSO DENSE IN THE SET OF CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS WHICH MEANS THAT  THERE IS SOME POLYNOMIAL ARBITRARILY CLOSE TO ANY CONTINUOUS  FUNCTIONS  FOR MANY PRACTICAL PURPOSES WHATEVER WE WANT TO DO WITH  A CONTINUOUS FUNCTION WE CAN DO WITH A POLYNOMIAL  IN ADDITION  SEVERAL USEFUL ANALYTICAL HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED IN ASSOCIATION WITH  POLYNOMIALS SUCH AS THE ROUTHHURWITZ ALGORITHM AND THE
